wslu (2.0.0-0ubuntu1) disco; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
  * Include src/etc/wsl.ico again in original source.
    The problematic image was replaced by upstream with one with DFSG-free
    license.
  * debian/gbp.conf: Set upstream tag format
  * debian/copyright: Update copyright info
  * Stop shipping mime info for wslview.
    Also drop fixing executable bits of runHidden.vbs
  * Fix running tests
  * Skip interop check in scripts
  * Run full test suite in WSL environments and only a subset on Linux
  * Makefile: Honor DESTDIR
  * debian/dirs: Create install dirs

    Using the logo of the distribution makes it visible which WSL
    installation will run the command executed by the shortcut.
  * Stop build-depending on dh-exec, it is not needed anymore
  * Fix one test failing on Windows
